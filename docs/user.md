## How to use Name of the project

- When you first open the web application you will see a drop-down menu with a map under it.
- From the drop-down menu, you can choose which government resource you want and then click "Go".
- After that, you will see icons for what option you chose from the pop up on the map. You can click on the icons and a popup with additional information, such as street address. You can zoom in and out on this map as much as you want to see exactly where the resources are located.
- Under the map, you will see a summary section, which will give the same information than the popups but in the form of a table. Information for speed cameras, for instance, includes posted and enforced speed, and information for fire stations includes if they have a medical unit and an ambulance on site. In the top right you can click to see our about and documentation pages, which will give you some background about our web application and assistance in the case that it is not working properly.
